<h2 id="what">What is USS: An Introduction</h2>
<p> Universal Studios Singapore (USS)  is <em>THE</em> go-to destination for anyone looking to have an awesome time in Singapore! Located in Singapore’s Sentosa Island, USS is one of the best amusement parks in Asia.<br>
<br>
Fun fact: USS is 20 hectares in size. That’s about the same space as around 2,000 of Singapore’s standard old 4-room 100sqm HDB flats.<br>
<br>
Why does it take up so much space? Well, this amusement park actually contains 7 themed worlds within it. Each world is based on a famous place (such as Hollywood and New York) or movie franchise (such as the Shrek-inspired Far Far Away and The Lost World of Jurassic Park). <br></p>

style="width:501px; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">


<p> Each of these themed worlds have their own unique architecture, rides and characters to see. Read on to find out more! </p>
<br>


<h2 id="why">Why visit USS: Activities & Attractions</h2>
<p><em>Rides</em><br></p>
<p>In USS, there is a ride for everyone. Thrill seekers can ride on the Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon rollercoaster, the tallest duelling roller coaster in the world! When you get on either Human or Cylon, both tracks of coasters start at the same time and engage in an exciting “battle”.<br></p>

<br>

<p>For a more relaxing experience, you can sail gently down the stream at Madagascar: A Crate Adventure. Follow Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria on a hilarious river ride adventure.<br></p>

<br>
<p>There are plenty of exciting and entertaining rides to enjoy in each of the USS worlds, but that’s not all!</p>
<br>

<p><em>Meet and Greets</em><br></p>
<p>Another exciting thing to look forward to is meet-and-greets with the characters of each fictional world. Stand a chance to meet the lovable Alex the lion and greet Egyptian royalty. Banter with the intimidating Megatron and laugh at the goofy antics of the Minions. You can even watch the sick dance moves of Puss in Boots or witness a baby Velociraptor hatch!</p>

<br>

<p>You can find the timings of these meet-and-greets in the Universal Studios App or on their physical brochures.<br></p>
<br>

<p><em>Seasonal Promotions</em><br></p>
<p>Think you’ve seen all of USS? USS is ever-changing with new sights to see over the course of the year. Its annual Halloween Horror Nights is a fan-favourite. During October, the theme park is transformed into a spooky landscape. Elaborate haunted houses replace the usual daytime attractions. Instead of the familiar and friendly Elmo and friends, terrifying clowns and ghouls roam the streets of USS and they are not afraid to get up close. Come and visit, if you dare!</p>
